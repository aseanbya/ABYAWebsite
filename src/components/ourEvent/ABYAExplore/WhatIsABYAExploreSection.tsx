                ABYA Explore provides a series of sharing and networking
                sessions that enable ASEAN youths to engage with, and be
                inspired, by industry professionals. In line with ABYA’s
                commitment to its vision and mission, ABYA Explore was conducted
                in the form of webinars, small-group networking sessions with
                professionals and business leaders in ASEAN. ABYA Explore
                imparts insights and knowledge to the youth on current industry
                trends across ASEAN. By gaining different perspectives on these
                issues, ABYA hopes to broaden the youths’ macro-knowledge of
                business and cultures of the region.
