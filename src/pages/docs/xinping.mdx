# Introduction

Hi! I'm Xinping, a second-year Computer Science student from NUS College.

I enjoy reading and analyzing literature, and playing games. I have a soft spot for cooperative board games as
well as two-play co-ops (which I play with my sister).

I created a [Reading Club Website](https://thereadingroom.vercel.app) using Next.js for Orbital 2023. It allows users
to join clubs and comment on books together.

I look forward to working on the ABYA website with all of you!
