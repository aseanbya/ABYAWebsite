# Introduction

Hi guys! Nice to meet you all!
My name is Yu Ting, and I'm currently taking a double major in BZA and Economics. I am also a student in NUSC.
I enjoy travelling, reading, and going on walks.

My previous development experience involves creating a module planner website https://nus-mods-plus-plus.vercel.app/.
However, I am still relatively new to this web development stuff, so I am still learning!
I'm really happy to be part of the ABYA team!
