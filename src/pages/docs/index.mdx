# Introduction

[**ABYA**](https://www.aseanbusinessya.com/) is built with the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

These docs aim to provide a high-level overview of the project, and are intended for developers focused on getting onboard
with the project.

## Tech Stack

-   [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is our language of choice, and as a superset of JavaScript, provides
    a layer of type safety at compile-time that JavaScript does not.
-   [**React**](https://react.dev) is a web framework on top of JavaScript for constructing user interfaces with [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
    and provides other utilities such as state management.
-   [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework on top of React with features for full-stack development such as
    server-side rendering, API routes, and more.
-   [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to write CSS within the JSX of components.

## Infrastructure

-   [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) is our hosting provider for our website at [lfg.travel](https://lfg.travel) and the serverless functions of our API.
    In addition, Vercel manages SSL certification automatically for us and also provides preview deployments for pull requests.
-   [**Name.com**](https://www.name.com/) is our domain registrar and DNS provider.
-   [**GitHub**](https://github.com/your-travel-planner/frontend) hosts our code repository and provides issue tracking and manages collaboration via pull requests.
