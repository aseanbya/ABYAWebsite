# Introduction

Hi everyone!
I'm Zhi Sheng, a second-year Computer Science student from NUS College.

I enjoy gymming, going for long walks, and reading.

My previous development expereince includes frontend development on the
[NUS College Student Life](https://nusc.club) website, where I worked on the animations and bookings page logic.
I also created an [API Gateway](https://github.com/tim-pipi/cloudwego-api-gateway) for Orbital 2023 in Go!

I'm glad to be a part of the team, and I look forward to working on this website with all of you!
